# Description

Hello! My name is Emilia Caccavo and I am a web development student.  I have begun to learn about the basics of designing webpages, with a special focus on using contrasting colors so they are easy to see by anyone and adjusting the design to fit multiple screens.  In making this webpage, I have applied my new skills to make an aesthetically pleasing and accesible website.  I have some experience in java and very limited experience in python.  I have loved html so far as it is a lot more straight forward and simple, but it is not boring.

This webpage displays my hobbies, crocheting and sewing.  I started crocheting a few years ago and started sewing in the past two years.  I have learned to make art dolls and decided to make my creations available to purchase.  I have loved every minute of it and just finished up another art doll today, one that took me almost 8 hours to create.  In this webpage, you'll see blues, pink, white and black.  These are some of the my favorite colors to use for art dolls and it was important to me to include them.  I want to go farther with my small business and showcase some of my computer skills through this webpage.  I hope I have accomplished that, and I hope anyone using my webpage sees the time and energy that went into it.  It is not perfect, but I am proud of my development in this course.

Throughout this project, I've learned how to:
- Use HTML elements like section, article, and header.
- Style elements with CSS while making it fit multiple screeens
- Creating a navbar for easy navigation throughout the webpage
- Add character to my webpage using hover effects, different fonts, and shadowing letters and paragraphs.
- Integrate media queries for different screen sizes.
