    <p>I want to be...</p>
    <p>A small business owner and a computer programmer!  Hello, my name is Emilia Caccavo, 
        an aspiring computer programmer and the owner of a small etsy shop.  I am 21 years 
        old and my mothers daughter, a sister, and the owner of a lucky cat named Esther.
        She is white with black splotches and wide yellow-greenish eyes.  She takes up a big
        chunk of my life so I bring her up a lot.  She was abandoned at a train station, but 
        she is living a comfy life now with plenty of food and cat beds to sleep in.
        
        My passion for computers started around 4 years ago and I managed to get a job at a computer 
        summer camp teaching kids how to make pixel art and the basics of coding. We used construct 
        and godot to teach the kids how to build video games.  It was a joy teaching them pixel art.
        For coding, I helped out here and there, but my coworkers were much more experienced in construct
        and godot. 

        I tried python out, but I have used java and HTML the most.  I enjoy coding and problem 
        solving, especially when I am able to make a long project finally work properly.  Java was, by far,
        the most challenging. I loved it, but it was hard to catch on.  

        I love building things from scratch, which is evident in almost all of my hobbies.
        I bake, cook, sew, crochet, write, and code.  I am also trying out roller blading, 
        but it's taking me longer to pick up than any other hobby I have tried.  I plan to 
        use my new learned computer skills for my small shop and my hobbies.

                    <h2>The Basics of Hover Effects!</h2>
    
                    <div>
                        <article id="lit">
    
                            <h2>Image Hover Effects:</h2>
            
                            <div>
                                <p>     In web design, hover effects are an important aspect of improving user experience and engagement.  They can make any coders webpage, even a beginner coder, look clean.  Image hover effects add flair and character to your webpage, while the users are grabbed by interesting visuals.  Incoporating hover effects into your webpage is sure to keep users on your webpage for longer.  I have even loved playing with the simple hover effect I added to my image gallery. </p>
            
                                <p>The image hover effect is an popular effect.  The image hover effect is when the images change or animate when the user hovers their cursor over it.</p>
            
                                <p>This effect adds some interactivity and depth to webpages, which can be entertaining to users.</p>
            
                                <p>In this blog article, we will explore how to use basic image hover effects using CSS. CSS is simple to use, but it makes stunning images for webpages.</p>
            
                                <p>What are some Image Hover Effects?</p>
            
                                <p>Simple Opacity change: This effect slightly fades the image when the user hovers their cursor over it. Image zoom effect: This effects enlarges the image as the user hovers over it.  It can be helpful for people with vision problems. Grayscale to color effect: transitions a grayscale image to full color.  I use a hover effect by making a photo a bit larger and adding shadow on the border of a photo.  It almost has a 3d effect, where it looks like a photo is floating off the page.</p>
            
                                <p>How to use basic hover effects?</p>
            
                                <p>The main CSS properties you will be using as transition to define the duration of the effect, hover which will be used to trigger the effect when the cursor is hovering over it, transform which can be used to change the image like making it bigger for the zoom effect, and filter to apply effects like grayscale to color, blur, or change the brigthness of an image. </p>
            
                                <p>With these properties, you can change them according to how you want your hover effects to look. Personally, I love to click on an image and keep the effect until I click offf it.</p>
            
                                <p>Conclusion:</p>
                                <p>Image hover effects are simple to use, but they can add a lot to the interactivity of a website. Hover effects create engaging visual effects that don't require complex code or JavaScript.  You can choose from a variety of effects like changing opacity, zooming in, or changing from grayscale to color.  These hover effects provide a polished look to your webpage.</p>
